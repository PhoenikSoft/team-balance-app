This is a manual on how to start up a dev version of a client.

* Install [Node v9.4.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v9.4.0/)
* Run `npm i`
* Run npm run start_react

Note: client side will query 'http://localhost:8080'. To change a host go to `client_react\src\config.js` and change `apiUrl` property, rerun the app.
